/*
  Stata script to process tuberculosis incidence data

  This example reads the sample CSV file from the processed data directory,
  renames columns for clarity, and exports a tidy table.  In a real use case
  you would import the raw WHO dataset, merge with population denominators
  and compute perâ€‘100,000 rates.
