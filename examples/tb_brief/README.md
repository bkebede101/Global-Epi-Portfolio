# Tuberculosis Brief (Sample)

This folder is a placeholder for a short technical or policy brief that summarises key findings from your tuberculosis analyses.  When applying for jobs that value communication skills, including a concise narrative about your work can be very effective.

## Suggested contents

1. **Title and introduction:** Provide a one‑sentence summary of the focus (e.g., “Trends in Tuberculosis Incidence and Mortality in Selected Countries, 2000–2023”).
2. **Methods:** Describe how you assembled and cleaned the data, referencing the WHO Global TB database【514790560382519†L49-L139】 and any population sources.  Mention any assumptions or limitations.
3. **Results:** Highlight key findings such as declining or rising incidence rates, differences between countries, and uncertainties.  Include simple charts or tables (these can be exported from Tableau).
4. **Implications:** Discuss what the findings mean for public health policy or further research.  Point out gaps in data quality or reporting that could affect interpretation.
5. **References:** Cite the WHO data sources and any other literature used.

Use this space to craft a polished two‑page PDF (e.g., with R Markdown or LaTeX) that you can attach to your job applications.  For now, this README serves as a template for what the brief should contain.
